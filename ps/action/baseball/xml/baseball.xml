            <main maintype="normal">The season looks extremely bright for the 2014 baseball team. We have a lot of potentil to pull off a Far East title with 13 returning Varsity members. We are also motivated after experiencing a huge loss in the finals last year and we hope this force really drives us a long way. Returning as our coach is Mr. Molina, who has put in many yers in this program and is a very seasoned coach. He will definitely play a huge role in tying the team together and to bring out our potential to a successful season.&amp;nbsp;</main>
            <main maintype="normal">Even though we have 13 returning members, however, we are still in need of new recruits. Tryouts for freshman/sophomore are going to be held on the field on Wednesday and tryouts for juniors/seniors are going to be held on Thursday. You will never know your capabilities until you try, so come out and give it a shot.&amp;nbsp;</main>

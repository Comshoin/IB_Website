            <main maintype="normal">Varsity tennis 2013 was the third year in a row where we became second in almost every competition: league, kanto, and far east. We got a new coach, Mr.Molina, along with two new players: one sophomore and one junior. Practices routines were a little different from previous years: we did band and ladder exercises before every practice and played against each other on Saturdays during our ladder matches. Although three seniors will be leaving this year, next year's team will beat ASIJ to take back the championship.&amp;nbsp;</main>
            <main maintype="normal">Practices were held daily from 7:00~8:00am on Tuesdays and Thursdays and from 15:35~17:30 on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.&amp;nbsp;</main>

            <main maintype="normal">Coached by Mr.O'Hagen, weightlifting is a strength sport that focuses on mastering three main lifts: squat, bench press, and deadlift. Students train three times a week to lift heavier weights with better posture and precision. Supplementary exercises are implemented in the training program as well to build balance and strength.&amp;nbsp;</main>
            <main maintype="normal">Powerlifting is one of the most popular sports at St.Mary's, with students joining in to prepare for other athletics and to keep fit during the season.&amp;nbsp;</main>

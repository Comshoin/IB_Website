        <subcontent>
        <main maintype="normal">Cross Country, or XC for short, is a sport offered here at St. Mary's International School. XC is all about running against both the other teams, and your own time. If you like running or just want to try something different then XC is the sport for you. Even if you're not the greatest at running you can still join. If you beat your PB that means you are doing great. We meet out on the field to stretch and warm up before our run after school. As a team, we travel by bus to meets at Tama Hills to compete against other schools in the Kanto Plain region. To finish all the meets there is also finals to really test your running ability. Besides finals there is also the possibility to attend the Far East and Guam meets. These meets are for the top seven runners on the team. Anyone can join and run; the only requirement to run at meets is a 5k time under 30 minutes, easy! Remember, run fast and donâ€™t fall.</main>

            <subheadline>Practice Time</subheadline>
            <main maintype="normal">Practice is four days a week from 3:30 to 5:00. To really be prepared for the course we have a variety of workouts. We run long, short, medium, and lots of hills for the dreaded killer hill. All of these different runs help prepare the team to do well at all of the meets.</main>

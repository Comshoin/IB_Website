            <main maintype="normal">Refugees International is a non-profit organisation that advocates for lifesaving assistance and protection for displaced people and promotes solutions to displacement crises. Refugees International is an independent organization, and accepts no government or UN funding. The St. Mary’s is comprised of 28 members who’ve dedicated their time to advocating Refugees Internationals cause and raising money and awareness for the issue. In order to achieve these goals the St. Mary’s wing has set for itself; they’ve organized a series of events to do exactly this. They’ve organized a dodge-ball tournament, participated in the charity run around the imperial palace, they’ve helped organize a big choral band concert at Suntory hall, made t-shirts and even visited the middle schoolers to raise awareness in the younger grades. They plan to sell ice cream later in the year as well as have a booth at the SMIS carnival.</main>

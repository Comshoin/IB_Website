            <main maintype="normal">Titones is a student-initiated a cappella group at St.Mary's. The objective of the group is not only to perform at various school events, but also to console the weary hearts of 3.11 Earthquake victims through music. It was founded in 2012, and the group currently consists of 8 seniors: Jae Yoon Jung (President), Tim Liao (Arranger), Nate Klein, Hyung Joon Jun, Kazuya Ogino, Alex Kang, and Jin Ho Ryu. Titones is active throughout the year, and because of its nature as a student-oriented group, there is no formal teacher involvement and is very flexible with scheduling. So far, the group has traveled to Tohoku region twice, and both of the trips were self-organized. This year, instead of traveling directly to Tohoku region, the group will perform at a charity concert to donate the profits for those in needs.</main>

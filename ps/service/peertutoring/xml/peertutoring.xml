            <main maintype="normal">This non-paid activity aims to improve the students who are suffering from low grades. The tutors who are involved in this activity, must have a well defined goal, personal commitment, and certain degree of academic understanding. Anyone who is interested in applying to become a tutor must contact Mrs. Molina, otherwise, it is not considered a proper service club for the CAS. In addition to that, although it is an all-year activity, due to the demand of the pupils, the chances of getting a student may vary. Any tutoring activities that is imposed or enforced by the school are also not considered as a service club activity for the CAS.&amp;nbsp;</main>

      <main maintype="normal">The Model United Nations Club is a club dedicated to stimulating students' global interaction through a simulation of the United Nations General Assembly, ECOSOC Council, Human Rights Council, and Security Council. Headed and supervised, by Mrs. Mcmillan, students participate in discourse. They debate about a variety of recent global issues such as the use of nuclear power or hostile forces in North Korea. Each group of students is assigned a country, and act as delegates of that country. Through thorough research and preparation, they offer the position their country on the topic through factual evidence and significant evidence and logic backing up the opinion. Through a formal procedure all the countries slowly transition into a debate where the objective is to find a resolution where the majority is benefited. This discourse that students allow them to participate in, not only allow students to improve their rhetoric and more sophisticated vocabulary, but also instigates much more research and absorption of knowledge of global issues and the reasons behind these issues.</main>

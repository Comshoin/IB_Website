            <h2>IB Newsletter</h2>
            <h3>December 2015</h3>
            <h4>Changes to Our IB Program</h4>
            <p>Beginning with the class of 2018, we will be making changes to our course offerings.</p>
            <h4>New English Course</h4>
            <p>Until this year, we have offered IB English Literature to our IB students. Beginning in 2016, however, we are introducing the relatively new IB English Language and Literature which can be taken instead of the pure English Literature. This course, while maintaining its commitment to promoting the skills taught in a regular literature class, will also focus on the language, including its ever evolving nature. Thus, students will be able to make use of modern linguistic formats such as blogs, media, and other electronic forms of communication; political speeches; language in a cultural context; and much more. This course offers exciting possibilities to explore English through modern and relevant contexts and formats, whilst preserving the main elements of a traditional literature course. We anticipate that this course will be very accessible, and geared towards the skill level of our IB student population. Nevertheless, for those students committed to a traditional approach to the study of literature, that option will be preserved amongst our offerings.</p>
            <h4>A New Structure for Science Courses</h4>
            <p>From the 2016 school year, students entering the IB science program will no longer be taking standard level science courses in one year. Instead, all science courses will be taken over the traditional two-year  period. We anticipate that this will bring strength to our science program and will enable both students and teachers to pace themselves in a manner that is less demanding. The structure will still be that both higher level and standard level students will take the same class in the first year. But then, in the second year, they will split off into either an SL course or an HL course. There will no longer be an IB examination offered to IB science students at the end of their Junior year.</p>
            <p>While this new approach has a number of advantages, not least of which is the more comfortable time-frame in which to cover the course material, students will have to choose their IB course plans very carefully in 10th Grade to make sure that they don’t regret their choices later. To that end, as much information as possible will be placed into their hands so that they can make wise choices.</p>
            <h3>March 2015</h3>
            <h4>Choosing an IB Course Plan</h4>
            <p>IB course selection is no easy task for 10th Grade students as they attempt to plan for their last two years of High School. Decisions taken in March of the 10th Grade year will reverberate not only into the Junior and Senior years, but also into college and beyond. Therefore, the decision-making process must be considered and involve various people apart from the students: parents, teachers, the IB Coordinator and the counselors all have roles to play at this key stage. Here are some useful pointers that could help untangle this difficult task.</p>
            <h4>Full Diploma or Course?</h4>
            <p>The first step is to consider whether the Full-Diploma, with all its additional work, is the right fit. It isn’t for everyone, and it would be a mistake to pursue it on the assumption that it’s what the smart students do. In fact, one can be academically very strong, but still choose to pursue a non-Full Diploma plan in order to promote other interests and commitments, such as music or a sport in which exceptional talent has been shown. Where a student plans to attend college is a factor in this decision. Typically, Europe and Australia favor the full Diploma; for the USA, it is less important. Canadian and Japanese colleges are somewhere between Europe and the USA…they prefer the Diploma, but will certainly consider students without it.</p>
            <h4>Stamina</h4>
            <p>The Full-Diploma, more than anything, requires stamina. That is, it is doable for most students, but the work never goes away, so it is like an endurance test over two years. It’s good to know this ahead of time, rather than finding out when grades are taking a dive sometime in the second semester of the Junior year. Students who have allowed themselves to slip academically in 9th or 10th Grade, despite starting out the year with the best intentions, need to give this consideration serious thought.</p>
            <h4>Interests</h4>
            <p>The Full-Diploma, more than anything, requires stamina. That is, it is doable for most students, but the work never goes away, so it is like an endurance test over two years. It’s good to know this ahead of time, rather than finding out when grades are taking a dive sometime in the second semester of the Junior year. Students who have allowed themselves to slip academically in 9th or 10th Grade, despite starting out the year with the best intentions, need to give this consideration serious thought.</p>
            <h4>Abilities</h4>
            <p>Students are encouraged to choose according to strengths. One may recognize that sciences are the key for careers in medicine or engineering, but a student would be foolish to attempt a selection of math and science higher level subjects if he has struggled in them in the past. If student were to persist in such a direction, success in the final exams would most likely be limited, and school grades in the meantime would be likely to take a tumble.</p>
            <h4>Discussion</h4>
            <p>The best choice of subjects for a student is likely to come out of a discussion with family and members of the faculty. It’s best to be thorough in exploring options, and to utilize good advice!</p>
            <br />
            <h3>November 2014</h3>
            <h4>The 2014 Results</h4>
            <p>We do not have a stringent admission policy into the IB Diploma program, preferring to allow students who wish to challenge themselves the opportunity to do so. Despite our open admissions policy, our results averaged 33.2, several points ahead of the IB world average. The high scores helped our students gain places at colleges which set high conditions for admissions, such as Oxford University and Kent University in the UK. </p>
            <h4>Changes in the IB Program at SMIS</h4>
            <p>This year, as we work within an overhauled high school schedule, the IB program at SMIS has undergone some significant changes. First, we have modified our course offerings so that selections have broadened. In the area of Group 4 sciences, there is now a Design Technology course which students can take both at the Higher Level and Standard Level.   Also, ITGS, previously offered only at the Standard Level, is being offered at the Higher Level. All this means more choices for students as they develop their IB course plans.</p>
            <h4>Five-year Review</h4>
            <p>Our formal five-year IB review process, including follow-up and matters to be address, comes to a conclusion in December, with new High School policies being adopted, and evidence of TOK integration in the classroom being more systematically generated. This valuable review process keeps our program vibrant by getting us to critically reflect on what we do.</p>
            <br />
            <h3>May 2014</h3>
            <h4>Course Changes</h4>
            <p>As this year draws to a close, we can look forward to some significant changes in the coming year. First, the structure of the program we can offer has been revised and, in some ways, enhanced. The IB Group 4 (Sciences) has been expanded to include Design Technology (HL and SL), and the Group 3 (Individuals and Societies) will also be expanded by formally offering ITGS at the HL level, not just the SL level. On the other hand, Architecture is not being offered as a course for in-coming Juniors, although there will still be a wide variety of ways for the IB Visual Arts students to express themselves in their pursuit of the IB Diploma. We are always looking for ways to keep our program strong and vibrant, and hope that these changes will, overall, add strength while addressing student needs and interests.</p>
            <h4>Advice to Rising Seniors</h4>
            <p>For the class of 2015, this summer is one of opportunity. Yes, of course there will be plenty of time to unwind, relax and recharge. But it is also a time to lay the foundations of a successful 12th Grade year. Here's how.</p>
            <p>First, be looking ahead to the year AFTER next. Where do you want to go to college? Have you checked requirements? Have you considered a visit to any campuses? What do you need to be doing now to make your hopes and desires a reality? By paying attention to what doors you need to open down the road, and understanding now how to do it, you can give yourself a useful advantage as you springboard out of here in 2016.</p>
            <p>Second, get ahead on any assigned work (for example, the Extended Essay) and make sure you do it as thoroughly as you can. The Fall of your Senior Year will be one of the most intensely busy times of your high school career, and anything you can do to alleviate that pressure beforehand will strengthen your efforts as you present the best of yourself to prospective colleges.</p>
            <p>Finally, address your weaknesses. If, for example, you are struggling in Japanese, take the time to get ahead with one of the readings at a pace you can manage. If it's math, go back and review the sections that caused you most trouble. </p>
            <p>Remember, by planning ahead a little, you can give yourself a well-deserved boost as you prepare to launch yourself into the future!</p>
            <p>	May all the students and families of SMIS have an enjoyable and fruitful summer!</p>			<br />            <h3>December 12, 2013</h3>
            <h4>The Best Program</h4>
            <p>A subtle change has come about within the IB program over the last two years. What most of us already knew, is now being openly endorsed by universities and education systems around the world as the IB becomes the standard in international education: namely, that students graduating with an IB Diploma have a superior level of education, and a marked advantage upon entering college. Long gone are the days when university admissions registrars had only a sketchy knowledge of the IB Program, and weren't sure how to treat it relative to other locally-established programs such as AP's in the USA and 'A'-levels in the UK. Now, almost without exception, the university admissions officers that visit our school from the USA, the UK and other countries, laud the IB as <i>the</i> program of excellence, one even going so far as to state that his university definitely favored students emerging out of an IB program over those coming from an AP program. Our high school counselor, Mr. Aaron Ragon, has also observed this decisive shift towards the IB, and his own experiences fall into line with this. "In the past couple of years, US colleges and Universities have come to realize that the IB Diploma program is the most rigorous course of study that a high school student can undertake. Because colleges want to see rigor in a student's curriculum, this makes the IB Diploma program the best option for college bound students," he says. Japanese universities have also recognized the merit of an IB education, so much so that local schools across Japan are now piloting IB programs in anticipation of the IB Diploma being recognized as an entrance qualification for Japanese nationals into university.
So, what is the message? Whether applying to the USA, UK, Canada, Australia, Korea or Japan, our students have a clear advantage over international students who come from schools without an IB program. But the IB is not just about offering students superior college opportunities. It's about the personal development that takes place while passing through the program, both academic and non-academic, which is why competitive universities around the world give special recognition to IB students in the first place!</p>
            <h3>October 11, 2013</h3>
            <h4>Self Improvement</h4>
            <p>As part of the on-going process of self improvement, St Mary's periodically evaluates itself. We then submit the results of our self evaluations to external groups for feedback. One of the self evaluations took place at the IB level, and we have since had some feedback from the International Baccalaureate Organization. The original questionnaire that we submitted along with the feedback and our response to that feedback can be viewed in the 'Documents' tab of the 'General' section of this site. In summary, here are the changes we are implementing as a result of our self study:
            </p>
            <br />
            <ol style="margin-left: 60px;">
                <li><b><u>Policies</u></b>: We're writing new policies at the high school level. These include policies on assessment, special educational needs, academic honesty and language. Additionally, the school is writing a school-wide admissions policy. Committees have been set up in each of these areas, and the target for completion and adoption is December 1, 2014</li>
                <li><b><u>TOK</u></b>: We're integrating Theory of Knowledge more completely into the classrooms. That means that IB students will be thinking more about the meaning and significance of the types of knowledge they encounter in their regular classes, not just in TOK class.</li>
                <li><b><u>Professional Development</u></b>: We're ensuring that as many people as possible in our IB Department get the latest IB-recognized professional development, wherever it might be taking place in the Asia Pacific region. This includes our head of school.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>We need your views!</h4>
            <p>If you're a member of this school community, you can help us improve. We are sending out surveys to students, parents and alumni about their impressions of education at St. Mary's. With the results of those surveys, we'll be in a position to tailor our programs more effectively to the needs of the community. So, please take a minute to fill out the survey on-line when it comes your way.</p>
            <h3>September 13, 2013</h3>
            <p>The most significant recent development in the IB Program at SMIS is undoubtedly the IB Website that went live on September 13, 2013. There are two main purposes behind its creation.</p>
            <ul>
                <li style='margin-left: 30px;'>To provide open and easy communication about matters relating to the IB at St Mary's with all community members</li>
                <li style='margin-left: 30px;'>To simplify the lives of faculty, students and parents by creating one place where essential documents, pieces of information and insights can be easily accessed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It is therefore a project that will be ongoing, with a view to constantly improve the end product. In this first phase, all tabs and links are present and active, with information available at each of them. In Phase 2, planned for the end of September, individual pages will be improved, more information will be provided, and more visuals uploaded to make the pages more interesting and attractive. In Phase 3, planned for mid-November, any newly needed tabs will be created, and links to individual subject areas with course overviews will be established. After that, there will be monthly updates.</p>
            <p>This project has been the result of the efforts of the Tech Group created last year to construct this site. It consists of three Seniors: Kent Shikama (special thanks and infinite kudos, Kent!) who has been the tireless technical brain behind this project; YongChul Yoon, who has worked hard on the many pages of the CAS program; and James Parker, who provided the creative banners and conceived of the bubble theme for the home page. Please bow to these talented gentlemen when you see them in the halls!</p>

            <h2>Schedule for Extended Essay, 2015 - 16</h2>
            <p>Extended Essay is part of the TOK course. Students will be graded according to their progress at various stages (not quality), and the final predicted grade, given by the advisors, will become a significant grade in the advisee's TOK class.</p>
            <h3>Student Deadlines and Responsibilities</h3>
            <h4>May, 2015</h4>
            <p>Students should have completed an outline, list of sources, and a full introduction and first 2,000 words by this date. The extended essay writing process should therefore be well underway before the summer.
            </p>
            <h4>September 1st</h4>
            <p>Hand in summer draft of extended essay to advisor.</p>
            <h4>Before September 8th</h4>
            <p>Meet with advisor to review summer progress and current status. The progress should indicate that the paper is close to meeting the word count of around 4,000 words.</p>
            <h4>September 21st</h4>
            <p>Preliminary draft, complete with introduction, conclusion, list of sources, and notes. This draft should be a first attempt at writing the complete paper.</p>
            <h4>October 13th</h4>
            <p><b>First full draft</b>, with full bibliography, notes, tables of contents, 
                abstract and cover page. This draft should be an improved version of 
                the first draft, taking into account the feedback relating to the first
                draft. It must include all aspects of the paper in finished format, 
                including a correctly formatted notes and bibliography, a table of 
                contents, numbered pages, an abstract (300 word summary) and a
                suitable cover page with a title (research question), name and IB
                candidate number.</p>
            <h4>Before October 20th</h4>
            <p>Oral interview and feedback session with advisor.</p>
            <h4>By November 9th</h4>
            <p><b>Submit final draft</b> to IB Coordinator.</p>
            <h4>Additional Notes</h4>
            <p>In addition to meeting the above deadlines, students must meet with their advisors according to the schedule below, under 'Advisor Responsibilities'.</p>
            <p>Foreign language students: All submission to the advisor must be accompanied by English translations, in summary format.</p>
            <h3>Advisor Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Feedback should be mainly verbal. Only one complete draft will be submitted for the advisor to give feedback on (Oct 14), upon which general written comments on the cover page are acceptable. The main function of the advisor will be to let the student know when he is veering off-track, and to keep him on target with the deadlines. It is not the function of the advisor to help re-word the essay, or to structure thoughts for the student.</p>
            <h4>Feedback/Discussion 1</h4>
            <p class='corner'>Before Sep 8: (Estimated time: 30 Minutes)</p>
            <p>Review the summer work and progress by the student. Make sure student is on the right track. He should be handing in close to a complete first draft.</p>
            <h4>Feedback/Discussion 2</h4>
            <p class='corner'>Between Sep 22 and Oct 4: (Estimated time: 30 - 45 Minutes)</p>
            <p>Fill out the relevant form, and have the student return it to the TOK teacher, along with the preliminary partial draft.</p>
            <h4>Feedback/Discussion 3, with 10 - 15 min Oral Recording</h4>
            <p class='corner'>Between Oct 14 and Oct 21: (Estimated time: 45 minutes)</p>
            <p>[See pages 20-21 of the general Extended Essay guide for more information.]</p>
            <p>Fill out the relevant form, and have the student return it to the TOK teacher, along with the first full draft. The IB Coordinator will make arrangements for the oral interview in terms of equipment and set-up.</p>
            <h4>Receive Final Essay from IB Coordinator</h4>
            <p class='corner'>By November 24</p>
            <p>Receive the essay and cover sheet (if available from IBO) from the IB Coordinator.</p>
            <h4>December 1st</h4>
            <p class='corner'>(Estimated time: 30 minutes)</p>
            <p>Fill out the official IB Extended Essay form, predicting a grade for the essay, and return it to the IB Coordinator, along with the essay and signed cover sheet.</p>
            <p><u>Note</u>: Extended Essay cover sheets are sometimes delayed in arriving from the IBO, so please go ahead and write a statement by word processor, and we can then just attach it to the cover sheet when available.</p>
            <p>Return the essay and signed cover sheet (or typed statement) to the IB Coordinator.</p>
            <h4>Total Estimated Time for Advisor</h4>
            <p>There will be about two hours of feed-back time with the advisee from August to December, and about 15 minutes by May. In addition, there will be about 30 minutes (total) time of form filling, and perhaps 2 - 3 hours of reading the advisee's essay and preparing feedback for the sit-down sessions. 
            </p><p>The total estimated time would be: <b>4 - 6 hours</b></p>
